Gridquencer for Ableton
=======================

A recode of a sequencer using the Ableton Push controller to allow for quick generation of polymetric sequences. 




TODO
  - Associate pads with note ids
  - Think about rests in a sequence 
  - colours: active beat, inactive beat
  - move regions? 
  - adjust a note
  - create a heuristics to apply to note generation


BUGS
  - modifying a clip should check for overlap
  - what if a region overlaps multipe regions?
